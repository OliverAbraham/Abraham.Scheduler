## OVERVIEW

Execute periodic actions in your app very easily.
Possible with only one line of code.
You can easily set up a scheduler that calls your method every seconds, minute, hour, day or special fractions.
You can also schedule a call at the beginning of every minute, hour or day.
For examples, please refer to the demo project on github.
